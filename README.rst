==========

This is a collection of images I scraped from the `Threadless T-shirt
web site`_ to use in benchmarking object recognition algorithms and
implementations.



A user can mark their history as public, in which case they appear in
the ``/users`` page, and their checkins can be mapped.

The module 4mapper uses to talk to the Foursquare API is available as
a separate repository: `foursquare-python`_.
